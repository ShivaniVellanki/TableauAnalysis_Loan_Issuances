# TableauAnalysis_Loan_Issuances
 Using Tableau, the project provides insights on loan decision-making by analyzing repayment patterns and default risks, offering precise, personalized loans. Tableau's visualization aids in understanding loan data, enhancing decisions.

The project leverages Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to revolutionize loan issuance processes, focusing on improving the decision-making capabilities of financial institutions. By automating the analysis of extensive datasets, AutoML identifies critical patterns and predictors of loan repayment and default, enabling more accurate risk assessments and personalized loan offerings. This approach enhances financial outcomes by adapting to market changes and borrower behaviors through continuous learning. The project showcases how companies like Avant and HSBC have utilized AutoML to accelerate credit risk model development and improve the accuracy of risk assessments, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective lending strategies.

A significant part of the project's success is attributed to its advanced data visualization and analysis through Tableau. The analysis within Tableau provides comprehensive insights into various metrics such as loan distribution, risk management, and profitability across different states and financial institutions. By segmenting banks by asset size and analyzing loan issuance, AutoML optimizes lending policies, ensuring tailored risk assessment and strategic decision-making. The Tableau dashboards offer a dynamic and interactive representation of the data, enabling stakeholders to pinpoint trends, assess performance, and make informed decisions quickly. This strategic use of Tableau analysis not only streamlines operational efficiency but also enhances the borrowing experience for customers, making financial services more accessible and personalized.
